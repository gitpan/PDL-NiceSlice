A source filter for PDL: take the pain out of slicing !

Perl source filtering is a way to experiment with new syntax
and the power is only limited by the sophistication of the
source parser.

Build the module in the usual way:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install

Everything is still experimental but the
approach seems promising.

The file 'local.perldc' contains some useful definitions to
experiment with the new syntax within the perldl shell.
